# Long Name Identifier (JAVA)
The purpose code is to the find the longest name from a list of names which is given by the user. This code asks the user to input a number which is represented by "n" and it means the amount of names they want to enter. Then, it will ask the user to enter the names then it will determine which is the longest name from the list. If there are ties for the longest names then it will let you know.
